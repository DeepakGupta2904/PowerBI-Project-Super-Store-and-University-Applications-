# PowerBI-Project-Super-Store-and-University-Applications-

Problem Statement 1:- 

Data Transformations Objective:- Design a dashboard to analyze the trend of admissions into state universities.

Key Tasks:- Data Modeling and Transformations:- Utilized Power BI Query Editor to perform various data transformations:-

1. Append Data:- Combined multiple datasets to form a unified data model.
2. Split Data:- Divided columns to enhance data granularity.
3. Column Formatting:- Applied consistent formatting to ensure data integrity.
4. Fill Columns:- Filled missing data in columns for a complete dataset.
5. Transpose Table:- Transformed rows into columns and vice versa for better data representation.
6. Pivot/Unpivot:- Reshaped data to facilitate analysis.
7. Merge Join:- Combined data from different tables using various join types.
8. Conditional Columns:- Created custom columns based on specific conditions.
9. Index Columns:- Added index columns for unique identification of rows.
10. Summary Tables:- Generated summary tables to provide aggregated insights.

Problem Statement 2:-

Key Tasks:- Custom Visualizations and Analytics:-

1. Built custom visualizations using expressions and filters to present admission trends.

2. Dashboard - Applications Analysis:-

A. Visualized total applications versus target trend by state.

B. Created a Geo Dashboard to map total applications by state.

C. Presented universities and their funds in a tabular format.

D. Displayed the percentage of applications by race.

3. Dashboard - Universities Analysis:-

A. Identified the top 10 universities by applications.

B. Compared top 10 universities by applications with and without special grants.
